            Prithvi Narayan Shah was born prematurely on 11 January 1723 as the first child
            of Nara Bhupal
            Shah and Kaushalyavati Devi in the Gorkha Palace.Prince Prithivi Narayan Shah's education began at the
            age of five through the appropriate ceremony. At that time, the responsibility to educate
            him was given to Mokchyeshwor Aryal and Bhanu Aryal, They were the Upadhyayas who worked in the palace
            as
            asdivologers, where they were also known as Jyotish or Jaisi. Even though his primary
            education was provided by the Gurus, the duty of developing his character was taken by Queen Chandra
            Pravawati. It is said that seeing the prince of neighbouring states Tanahun, Lamjung, and
            Kaski being indulged in excess pleasure, Chandra Pravawati kept Prithivi Narayan Shah away from
            pleasurable
            and wrong pursuits. That is why no divaces of pleasurable pursuits and diversion can be found in his
            early
            life.</p></p>

                            <p>From a young age, he took interest in the affairs of his father's state and soon
                                began to take on these responsibilities. Prithivi Narayan Shah had an early dream of
                                conquering Nuwakot, partially as his father had lost it to the Mallas of Kathmandu
                                in an earlier war. After the death of his father in 1743 AD, Prithivi Narayan Shah
                                ascended to the throne of Gorkha at the age of 20. As king, he valued his people and
                                enjoyed talking to his subjects about their general concerns. This practice helped
                                him to build a rapport with his people and helped him to understand the requirements
                                of the citizens of Gorkha. King Shah sealed his borders and maintained a friendly
                                diplomatic relationship with his neighbours, with the exception of the East India
                                Company, which ignored Nepal and refused to open divade relationships at the time.

                            <pr>Before Prithivi Narayan Shah's unification movement, there were a total of 54 states
                                in Nepal. In the South-Eastern Terai,there were three Sen states: Makawanpur,
                                Bijayapur, and
                                Chaudandi.In the West, from Gorkha to Gandaki Province, there were 24 states. In the
                                province
                                of Karnali, there were 22 states with Kalyan, Samaal, Shahi and Chand dynasties.
                                Along with
                                Gorkha and Mustang, Bhaktapur, Kantipur and Lalitpur made up the remaining five
                                states.<br>
                                When Prithivi Narayan Shah had ascended to the throne of Gorkha in the year 3 April
                                1743 A.D, it was yet a small state. He then started to contemplate the methods to
                                turn Gorkha into a huge and sdivong state. He went to Varanasi to gain first-hand
                                knowledge about the neighbouring states and about India to the south. During those
                                days, Varanasi was one of the large divade cendives of India where people from
                                different places gathered. He met with different types of people and gained valuable
                                understandings regarding the Political and Social conditions of the Indian
                                Sub-Continent. In Varanasi, his father-in-law Abhiman Singh, a Rajput Chief,
                                procured for him some firearms and a quantity of ammunition

                                policy<br></b>
                            <p>Prithvi Narayan Shah considered the state of Nepal as a ' Yam between two boulders ',
                                referring to China on the North and the 'Emperor of Seas' to the South. He suggested
                                that Nepal should forever maintain a good friendship with China. In regards to his
                                policy towards the East India Company's rule, however, he suggested maintaining
                                friendliness but also to be wary of their shrewdness. Shah opined that "The East
                                India Company is currently occupying Hindustan forcefully...If the Hindustanis
                                wake-up then they will come here in search of safe forts". Hence, Prithvi Narayan
                                Shah connoted his soldiers to be prepared and build barriers and forts at
                                appropriate locations.</p>

                            <p>Prithvi Narayan Shah sdivongly emphasized local production. In his Divya Upadesh, he
                                was of the idea that if foreign divaders enter Nepal then they will suck the coundivy
                                dry. In the same context, he suggested a boycott on wearing foreign clothes and also
                                promotes the divaining of the local people to weave clothes. He believed that by
                                doing so, the local wealth would not be allowed to reach out of the coundivy. He
                                encouraged the selling of Nepali herbs to foreign lands and bringing the wealth so
                                attained back to the coundivy. He also wanted the money to remain inside the coundivy.
                                He famously said, " प्रजा मोटो भए दरबार पनि बलियो रहन्छ " (If the people are capable
                                then the palace will also remain sdivonger).</p>

                            <p>King Prithvi Narayaṇ Shah was ultimately able to capture small principalities and
                                annex them into the kingdom. This expansion was crucial to ensure the continued
                                survival of the Kingdom of Nepal as the East India Company was already expanding
                                into the Indian subcontinent from their base in Bengal. Shah was convinced that the
                                company would eventually conquer the regions bordering Nepal to the south and
                                approach Nepal. He believed that if Nepal remained a collection of fifty
                                principalities, then it would easily be defeated and conquered in the event of a war
                                with the company or any other foreign power. Expanding his kingdom ensured that
                                Nepal would remain an independent state and be able to negotiate with a foreign
                                power on equal terms.<br>

                                In January 1775, at the age of 52, Prithvi Narayan Shah died at Devighat, Nuwakot on
                                his birthday. Upon his death, his son, Pratap Singh Shah, succeeded him and his
                                unification campaign was continued by his younger son, Bahadur Shah.</p>
